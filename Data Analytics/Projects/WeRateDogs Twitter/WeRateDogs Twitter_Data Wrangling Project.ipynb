    "# Data Wrangling Project - WeRateDogs Twitter Archive\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because \"they're good dogs Brent.\" WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "![WeRateDogs Twitter](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/October/59dd378f_dog-rates-social/dog-rates-social.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Steps Overview\n",
    "With the main focus of this project being on data wrangling, it will be divided into the following steps:\n",
    "1. Gathering data\n",
    "2. Assessing data\n",
    "3. Cleaning data\n",
    "4. Storing data\n",
    "5. Analyzing and visualizing data\n",
    "6. Reporting\n",
    "      - My data wrangling efforts\n",
    "      - My data analyses and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aim\n",
    "The goal is to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for \"Wow!\"-worthy analyses and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "In this project, I will work on the following three datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Enhanced Twitter Archive\n",
    "This data was provided by the Udacity team. The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything. One column the archive does contain though: each tweet's text, which was used to extract rating, dog name, and dog \"stage\" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) to make this Twitter archive \"enhanced.\" Of the 5000+ tweets, they filtered for tweets with ratings only (there are 2356).\n",
    "![image.png](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/October/59dd4791_screenshot-2017-10-10-18.19.36/screenshot-2017-10-10-18.19.36.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "They extracted this data programmatically, but they didn't do a very good job. The ratings probably aren't all correct. Same goes for the dog names and probably dog stages (see below for more information on these) too. I'll need to assess and clean these columns if I want to use them for analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Additional Data via the Twitter API\n",
    "Back to the basic-ness of Twitter archives: retweet count and favorite count are two of the notable column omissions. Fortunately, this additional data can be gathered by anyone from Twitter's API. Since I have access to Twitter's API and the tweet IDs of the tweets in the Enhanced archive, I can gather the needed data for all 5000+ by querying Twitter's API.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Image Predictions File\n",
    "Every image in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive was run through a neural network that can classify breeds of dogs. The results: a table full of image predictions (the top three only) alongside each tweet ID, image URL, and the image number that corresponded to the most confident prediction (numbered 1 to 4 since tweets can have up to four images).\n",
    "![imgpredict](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/October/59dd4d2c_screenshot-2017-10-10-18.43.41/screenshot-2017-10-10-18.43.41.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So for the last row in that table:\n",
    "* `tweet_id` is the last part of the tweet URL after \"status/\" → https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/889531135344209921\n",
    "* `p1` is the algorithm's #1 prediction for the image in the tweet → **golden retriever**\n",
    "* `p1_conf` is how confident the algorithm is in its #1 prediction → **95%**\n",
    "* `p1_dog` is whether or not the #1 prediction is a breed of dog → **TRUE**\n",
    "* `p2` is the algorithm's second most likely prediction → **Labrador retriever**\n",
    "* `p2_conf` is how confident the algorithm is in its #2 prediction → **1%**\n",
    "* `p2_dog` is whether or not the #2 prediction is a breed of dog → **TRUE**\n",
    "* etc."
