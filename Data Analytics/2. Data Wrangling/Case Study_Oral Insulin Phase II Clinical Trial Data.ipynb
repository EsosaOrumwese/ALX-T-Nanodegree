    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### DISCLAIMER: This data isn't 'REAL'\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diabetes\n",
    "\n",
    "The increasing prevalence of diabetes in the 21st century is a problem. Patients have symptoms like:\n",
    "* unusual thirst\n",
    "* frequent urination\n",
    "* extreme fatigue\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discovery of Insulin\n",
    "In the 1920s, insulin was discovered by Frederick Banting. Most of the food we eat is turned to glucose, or sugar, for our bodies to use for energy. The pancreas, an organ near the stomach, makes a hormone called insulin, to help glucose get into the cells of our bodies. When you have diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use its own insulin as well as it should. And this causes sugars to build-up in the blood.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Banting's discovery of insulin, pharmaceutical companies began large-scale production of insulin. Although it doesn't cure diabetes, it's one of the biggest discoveries in medicine. When it came, it was like a miracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges with Insulin\n",
    "The default method of administration is by a needle, multiple times a day. Insulin pumps are a more recent invention. These are insulin delivering devices that are semi-permanently connected to a diabetics body.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Future: Oral Insulin?\n",
    "Wouldn't it be great if diabetics could take insulin orally? This is an active area of research, but historically the roadblock is getting insulin through the stomach's thick lining.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Dataset: Auralin and Novodra Trials\n",
    "We will be looking at the phase two clinical trial data of 350 patients for a new **innovative oral insulin** called **Auralin** - a proprietary capsule that can solve this stomach lining problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase two trials are intended to:\n",
    ">* Test the efficacy and the dose response of a drug\n",
    ">* Identify adverse reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this trial, half of the patients are being treated with Auralin, and the other 175 being treated with a popular injectable insulin called Novodra. By comparing key metrics between these two drugs, we can determine if Auralin is effective."

For Auralin to be deemed effective, it must be \"noninferior\" to Novodra, the current standard for insulin. This \"noninferiority\" is statistically defined as the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval being less than 0.4% for the difference between the mean HbA1c changes for Novodra and Auralin (i.e. Novodra minus Auralin)."

This [diversity](https://www.clinicalleader.com/doc/an-fda-perspective-on-patient-diversity-in-clinical-trials-0001) is reflected in the `patients` table.\n",
    "- Ensuring column names are descriptive enough is an important step in acquainting yourself with the data. 'Descriptive enough' is subjective. Ideally you want short column names (so they are easier to type and read in code form) but also fully descriptive. Length vs. descriptiveness is a tradeoff and common debate (a [similar debate](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/176582/is-there-an-excuse-for-short-variable-names) exists for variable names). The *auralin* and *novodra* column names are probably not descriptive enough, but you'll address that later so don't worry about that for now."
